# JavaAnimator
A Java Animator built for an object-oriented design class at Northeastern University.

This Animator takes a text file of animation instructions and stores the information in an intermediate format.
It can describe each animation as an SVG, a Swing graphic in a GUI, or a textual representation.

Almost all of this code is my own work. However, the TweenModelBuilder class supplied by the course instructor.
